    <p>I’ve been running regularly for almost 10 years. Before today, believe it or not, I’ve never actually reflected on this amount of time. It honestly took me by surprise. I began to think: what’s kept me interested all this time? Through
      injury and setback, trial and tribulation, success and accomplishment, why have I continued to run? How do I even classify what running is to me?
      <br><br>
      It’s not really a hobby — I’ve had many hobbies throughout my life, and most have been relatively short-lived. I used to rock climb, but eventually I stopped going. I used to row but I burned out pretty quickly - those 6 am outings in the dead
      of
      the winter. I
      even had a coin collection when I was younger. And a card collection. And a manga collection.
      <br><br>
      I wouldn’t say it’s a passion either — I’m passionate about running, but I’m also passionate about architecture and design. About reading. Movies. Japanese food.
      <br><br>
      Running goes deeper.
      <br><br>
      Unlike many, I didn't get started during high school or even at university. During my chilhood I hated physical exercise with passion - PE was my worst subject and personal nightmare; and at university I lacked the time to do anything else
      other
      than attend to the classes and work through the various assignments they kept throwing at us.
      However, after a bad break-up I needed something to get my mind off it and what better than being unable to breathe through the torture that was physical exercise.
      <br><br>
      I didn’t take to running right away. I was completely terrible in the beginning, and could not go more than 5 minutes without stopping, exertion and sweat rolling down my neck. I kept at it but it never felt natural, more like a fight for
      survival.

      For the next two or three years, in my early 20s, I ran somewhat regularly but without purpose or intelligence. I had no real plan or training schedule and didn’t take care of my body the way I should have. Stretching and recovery
      were time wasted. Formal schedule too cumbersome.

      Everything changed when I was 24. I had been for almost a year without running at all, lost in an abyss of job interview after job interview, during the worst of the housing crisis. Depressed and despairing, I moved countries in search of work,
      found it; and with it a routine again. I stopped drinking and staying up late and joined the social lunch runs at my workplace, with it restarting my running. The familiar feeling of fighting to survive was back, but this time I had colleages
      to
      motivate me. Eventually I also found I was anaemic during this time, and started taking iron pills. This proved to be life-changing. Suddenly running felt - if not easy, at least bearable.
      <br><br>
      I kept running. Although this time, I began to run more intelligently and with mindfulness. Not every run had to be an all-out fight. Recovery runs, slow runs had just as much of a purpose as a hard-fought tempo run
      or interval session.
      <br><br>
      I entered my first race. And then my second, and third; building up to the half marathon distance.
      <br><br>
      I began to run with meaningful intent —After a hard, frustrating day at work an easy 4-miler can be better than any beer. Making big life decisions became easier after I would sort them out during a run. Managing the anxiety of these decisions
      is
      also easier during a run.
      <br><br>
      I began to run with a specific goal in mind: amping myself up, winding myself down, working through a problem and everything in-between.
      <br><br>
      I discovered the beauty and serenity that is trail running. The soft dirt under foot, the undulating terrain, the sounds of the forest, the sunlight through the trees. It’s on the trails that I discovered how truly spiritual running can be.
      <br><br>
      Running is more than just a passion, a hobby, or something constructive to keep my physical mind and body healthy as I age. It’s one of my best friends and one of the most important relationships I have.</p>

    <h2>Five reasons to take up running</h2>
    <ol>

      <div class="reason-row">


        <li><em>You don't need any gear..and can start today!</em>

          <p>Running is objectively one of the sports with less equipment that exist. It is just a natural stretch from the most natural human form of movement, walking</p>
        </li>
      </div>
      <div class="reason-row">


        <li> <em>You don't need any membership..running is free</em>

          <p>Sure, you can spend a vast amount of money on carbon-fibre trainers, high-tech apparel and gadgets, but at a basic level, all you really need to get started is a pair of decent trainers and a comfortable outfit</p>
        </li>
      </div>
      <div class="reason-row">


        <li><em>You will get out in the open</em>

          <p>Going for a run is the perfect reason to get outside and enjoy the therapeutic benefits of nature, whether it’s a remote trail or just your local park. One study published in Environmental Science And Technology found that people who
            exercised outdoors reported increased energy, decreased feelings of depression and were more likely to repeat their workouts.</p>

        </li>
      </div>
      <div class="reason-row">


        <li><em>It shootes stress..and anxiety</em>

          <p>Running makes your body release ‘feel-good’ hormones like dopamine, serotonin, endorphins and norepinephrine which contribute to the amazing feel you get during and after a run. Even walking can contribute to an improved mood.</p>
        </li>
      </div>
      <div class="reason-row">


        <li><em>It's good for your joints</em>

          <p>This is a special shoutout to my boyfriend, who loves to (complain) argue that running is bad for your joints in particular; and your overall health in general. Research from Stanford University in California found recreational runners
            showed less wear and tear on their joints. In addition, research in the journal Osteoporosis International found that older runners had higher bone mineral density than sedentary folk and swimmers of the same age.</p>
